Hi there and welcome! 

This is a program corresponding to this Sales Tax Problem: 

There are a variety of items for sale at a store. When a customer purchases items, they receive a receipt. The
receipt lists all of the items purchased, the sales price of each item (with taxes included), the total sales taxes for
all items, and the total sales price.

Basic sales tax applies to all items at a rate of 10% of the itemâ€™s list price, with the exception of books, food, and
medical products, which are exempt from basic sales tax. An import duty (import tax) applies to all imported items
at a rate of 5% of the shelf price, with no exceptions.

Write an application that takes input for shopping baskets and returns receipts in the format shown below,
calculating all taxes and totals correctly. When calculating prices plus tax, round the total up to the nearest 5
cents. For example, if a taxable item costs $5.60, an exact 10% tax would be $0.56, and the final price after adding
the rounded tax of $0.60 should be $6.20. 

In order to run this program, you will need a text editor that can read C#, preferably Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2019 should work fine. 

For the user, you should just be able to go to the "main.cs" and compile. 

You may enter in the specifications for the products and your reciept will build and output out your reciept with the sales tax and final tax.
